# FastAPI
 FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for building RESTful APIs, web services, and microservices. FastAPI leverages Python 3.6+ features, type hints, and asynchronous programming to provide automatic validation, serialization, and documentation of API endpoints. Here are some key features and information about FastAPI:

Fast and Performant: FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, which are high-performance libraries. It utilizes asynchronous programming, making it capable of handling high concurrency and providing excellent performance.

Type Hinting and Validation: FastAPI uses Python's type hinting to define request parameters, request bodies, and responses. This allows for automatic validation of incoming requests and responses based on the specified data types.

Automatic API Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation, which is served by default at the /docs endpoint. This documentation is based on the provided type hints and includes request and response examples, making it easy for developers to understand and consume the API.

Built-in Request and Response Models: With Pydantic, FastAPI allows you to define models for request bodies and responses, simplifying data validation and serialization/deserialization processes.

Dependency Injection: FastAPI supports dependency injection, allowing you to declare and use dependencies in your route functions. This helps manage common tasks, such as database connections or authentication, in a modular and organized way.

WebSocket Support: FastAPI provides WebSocket support through the usage of the WebSocket route decorator. This allows you to build real-time applications using WebSockets in addition to traditional HTTP APIs.

Authentication and Security: FastAPI supports various authentication methods, including API keys, OAuth2, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It also includes built-in security features to help protect against common web security issues.

Automatic OpenAPI and JSON Schema Generation: FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI and JSON Schema documents, which can be used to describe your API and integrate with other tools in the API ecosystem.

Synchronous and Asynchronous Endpoints: FastAPI allows you to define synchronous and asynchronous (using async and await) endpoints, giving you the flexibility to handle tasks that may require asynchronous execution.

Compatibility with Existing Python Ecosystem: FastAPI is compatible with existing Python libraries and frameworks, allowing you to use familiar tools to complement your API development.

FastAPI has gained significant popularity due to its speed, modern features, and straightforward syntax, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance APIs with Python.
